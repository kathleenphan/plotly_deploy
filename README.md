In this week's module I created an interactive webpage, which had a drop down menu and showcased 3 interactive charts. The first is a bar chart, which showed OTU ID's and Values. A bubble chart showing the same information. The last graph is a gauge chart which should show the frequency of washing per week. The module used the index.html file, which drew from two js files.
