In this week's module I created an interactive webpage, which had a drop down menu and showcased 2 interactive charts. The first is a bar chart, which showed OTU ID's and values. The next chart was a bubble chart showing the same information inbcluding pop-up information when you hover above the data points. The module used the index.html file, which drew from two js files.
